# Airlines_Passenger_Satisfaction
This is my final project in Dibimbing Data Science Bootcamp. The objective of this project is to predict whether a passenger is satisfied or neutral/dissatisfied. In this project, SMOTE method is used to deal with the imbalance of target column. Forward feature selection is applied on this data set which reduces the data from 22 features to 16 features. Hyperparameter increased the accuracy of the LightGBM model into 96%, which is slightly higher with the accuracy before reducing some features. Business insights are obtained by doing exploratory data analysis. Almost 69% of the passengers are business traveler. Stacked bar chart of likert-scaled data shows that business travelers whose neutral/dissatisfied want a good services that will save their time such as inflight wifi service, ease of online booking, gate location, and departure/arrival time convenient.
